# Quiz Application

This repository contains a Python-based Quiz Application that allows users to register, log in, attempt quizzes, and view results. The application has two versions:

**In-memory Version**: The data is stored in memory and is lost when the program terminates.
**File-handling Version**: User data, quiz questions, and results are persisted in text files.

## Features

**User Registration**: Users can register by providing a username, enrollment number, email ID, and password.
**User Login**: Registered users can log in with their credentials.
**Attempt Quiz**: Users can attempt random quiz questions.
**Show Results**: Users can view their quiz score.
**In-memory Version**: All data is stored temporarily in memory during the session (no data persists when the program exits).
**File-handling Version**: Data (user information and quiz results) is stored in text files (userDetails.txt, DSA.txt, DBMS.txt, Python.txt) and persists across sessions.
